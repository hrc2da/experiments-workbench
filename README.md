## Getting Started
To define an experiment, create a `*.spec.yaml` file in the experiments directory. See the `experiments/examples directory` for an example.

To run it, call `run_experiments.py`.

To run the example, first call `setup_example.py` and then `run_experiments.py`.

All experiment parameters should be defined first in `run_spec.yaml`.

See `__init__.py` in the environments and agents folders for abstract class definitions.
